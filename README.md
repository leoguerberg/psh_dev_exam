Random game simulator
======

This are my first steps into developing web applications with ReactJS and NodeJS.

This application simulates every 5 minutes a match beteween 0-10 random generated players with random information (nickname of the player and score in this new match generated).

It uses MySQL to save the information.


Finally, it shows a dashboard (that refreshes every 10 seconds) in the browser with the top 10 players with most score of all history. 
Also, it provides the posibility to download this dashboard in CSV format.
